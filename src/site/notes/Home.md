Hello ☁️

There's not much here (yet), but I mainly take notes about #tech, #math, #finance and #tutorial. Hopefully I will continuously grow this garden.

There's no exact organization right now, since I don't even have much notes to be organized. Being too deep on organizing with using methods like zettelkasten, atomic notes, and MOC keeps me procrastinate from doing the actual work, ==write and study!== Perfection kills progress. I'll just organize the notes later.

Also, this is my second time setting up my digital garden, which you can read about [[How I Publish My Obsidian Vault For Free Using Digital Garden Plugin\|here]].
