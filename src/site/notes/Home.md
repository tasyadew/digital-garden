Hello.

There's not much here (yet), but I mainly take notes about #tech, #math, #finance and #tutorial. Hopefully I will continuously grow this garden. That's one of my 2025 goal.

Also, this is my second time setting up my digital garden, which you can read about [[How I Publish My Obsidian Vault For Free Using Digital Garden Plugin\|here]].
