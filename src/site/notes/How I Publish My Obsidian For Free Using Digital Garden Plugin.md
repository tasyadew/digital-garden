So, you also interested to pursue learning in public or just want to do it for fun just like me? Here's a tutorial if you want to publish your Obsidian vault just like I did. 


## List of tools I use
1)  [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - Of course, for note-taking.
2) [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) - For hosting static-generated site
3) A domain name. I purchase my domain name through [Cloudflare Registrar](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/), because the price of the domain maintain the same for the following year.
4) Digital Garden Plugin - Install the community plugin. The [docs](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) provides useful resources on how to setup and modify the site.
